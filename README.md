# Learn php with t0mri
**Hola!** I'm [t0mri](https://github.com/t0mri). I have been learning PHP from scratch, so why wouldn't I learn it with little projects? In this repository, there are a bunch of mini projects that you can try building yourself. You should take a look if you have any doubts or maybe if you want to see how I built them. So yeah, let's get started!

## Prerequisites
By the way, I am lazy. So I probably used htmx and UnoCSS, let me explain what they are in a nutshell:
- [htmx](https://htmx.org/) - A frontend library that allows almost all elements in a document to make HTTP requests and expects HTML strings as responses, which will be placed in the desired location in the document.
- [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/) - An atomic CSS engine that is better than TailwindCSS.
They are awesome tools. I highly recommend you learn them.
